# Context: A Guide to Accommodation for Bangladeshi Students

## 1. University Hostels (On-Campus)
- **Pros:**
  - **Safety & Security:** 24/7 security, CCTV surveillance, and strict in-times (usually around 9:30 PM - 10:00 PM) make it the safest option, especially for first-year students.
  - **Convenience:** Located on campus, saving travel time and cost. All facilities like mess, laundry, and academic blocks are within walking distance.
  - **Simplified Formalities:** The university handles the C-Form and provides the necessary address proof for FRRO and bank accounts.
- **Cons:**
  - **Cost:** Can be more expensive than some off-campus options.
  - **Food:** The mess food is typically North Indian cuisine, which may require an adjustment period.
- **Room Furnishings:** A standard hostel room includes a bed, mattress, study table, chair, and a cupboard. Students need to bring their own bedding (pillows, bedsheets) and personal items.
- **Technology & Internet:** 
  - WiFi speed: 50-100 Mbps (sufficient for online classes and streaming)
  - Common areas have better connectivity for video calls home
  - Power backup available during outages
  - Each room has 2-3 electrical outlets
- **Laundry Services:** ‚Çπ200-300 per month for washing service, or coin-operated machines (‚Çπ20 per load)
- **Room Types & Costs (2025-26):**
  - **Single AC:** ‚Çπ1,80,000/year
  - **Double AC:** ‚Çπ1,50,000/year  
  - **Triple Non-AC:** ‚Çπ1,20,000/year
  - **Quad Sharing:** ‚Çπ1,00,000/year

## 2. Off-Campus Accommodation (PG/Rented Flats)
- **PG (Paying Guest):** Renting a room in a privately-run hostel or a large house.
- **Rented Flat:** Sharing a 2BHK or 3BHK flat with other students.
- **Pros:**
  - **Independence:** More freedom with no strict in-times.
  - **Food:** Freedom to cook your own food or eat out.
  - **Cost:** Can sometimes be cheaper, especially when sharing a flat.
- **Cons:**
  - **Safety:** Security is the student's own responsibility.
  - **Logistical Hassles:** The student is responsible for getting a formal rent agreement, coordinating with the landlord for the C-Form, and managing utility bills (electricity, internet).
  - **Travel:** Incurs daily travel costs and time to get to the university.
- **Recommendation:** It is **highly recommended** for all first-year students to stay in the university hostel to ensure a smooth transition and completion of all legal formalities. They can explore off-campus options from the second year onwards if they wish.
