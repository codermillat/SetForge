# Context: Addressing common problems, challenges, and negative scenarios faced by students.

## Scenario 1: Visa Rejection
- **Problem:** A student's visa application is rejected.
- **Common Reasons:** Incomplete documentation, incorrect information on the application form, or failure to convince the visa officer of the intent to study.
- **Solution:**
  1.  Immediately contact the university's International Admissions Office.
  2.  Request a new, updated set of visa letters if required.
  3.  Carefully review all documents to find the error.
  4.  Re-apply with the corrected documents. The university will provide support throughout this process.

## Scenario 2: Failing a Subject (Backlog)
- **Problem:** A student fails one or more subjects in a semester.
- **Consequence:** The student will lose their merit-based scholarship from the next academic year onwards, as per the university's continuation policy.
- **Solution:**
  1.  The student must appear for a "backlog" or "re-examination" for that subject in the next available semester.
  2.  They must pay a separate re-examination fee for each subject.
  3.  Clearing all backlogs is mandatory to be awarded the final degree.

## Scenario 3: Difficulty with Food or Homesickness
- **Problem:** A new student finds it difficult to adjust to the local food and feels homesick.
- **Solution:**
  1.  **Community Support:** Connect with the Bangladeshi Student Association on campus. Senior students are the best resource for guidance and support.
  2.  **Explore Options:** Explore different canteens on campus, as they offer varied cuisines.
  3.  **Cooking:** Some hostels may have facilities for light cooking (e.g., induction cooktops for making noodles or rice).
  4.  **Counseling:** All universities have student counselors to help with mental well-being and adjustment issues.

## Scenario 4: Scholarship Continuation Issue
- **Problem:** A student's CGPA drops below the required threshold (e.g., below 8.0 at Galgotias) or they get a backlog.
- **Consequence:** The scholarship is discontinued for the next academic year. The student will have to pay the full tuition fee for that year.
- **Solution:** The student can work hard to improve their grades in the subsequent year. While the scholarship may not be reinstated for the year it was lost, some universities may consider reapplying it for the final year if the student shows significant academic improvement. This is at the university's discretion.
