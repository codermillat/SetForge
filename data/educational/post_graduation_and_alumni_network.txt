# Context: Post-Graduation Pathways and Alumni Support for Bangladeshi Students.

## 1. Career and Placement After Graduation
- **Placement Process:** The university's placement cell facilitates the entire process, from resume building and mock interviews to coordinating on-campus recruitment drives where companies hire students directly.
- **Converting to Employment Visa:** To work in India after graduation, an international student must secure a job offer from a company. The company then sponsors the conversion of the Student Visa into an Employment Visa. This is a standard process for placed students.

## 2. Higher Studies (Masters/Ph.D.)
- **Global Recognition:** Degrees from NAAC 'A+' accredited universities like Sharda, Amity, and AKTU (for G.L. Bajaj) are well-recognized globally. Graduates can apply for Master's or Ph.D. programs in the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and Europe.
- **University Support for Higher Studies:** The university provides recommendation letters (LORs) and official transcripts required for applications to foreign universities. The experience of studying in a diverse, international environment in India strengthens a student's profile for global applications.

## 3. Alumni Network and Degree Attestation
- **Alumni Network:** Universities maintain an alumni network, which can be a valuable resource for career guidance and professional connections. Many Bangladeshi alumni who have graduated are working in top positions in Bangladesh, the Middle East, and Western countries.
- **Degree Attestation for Use in Bangladesh:**
  - After receiving the final degree certificate from the Indian university, students who wish to work or study further in Bangladesh may need to get it attested.
  - The process typically involves attestation from the **Indian Ministry of External Affairs** and then from the **Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi**. This process verifies the authenticity of the degree for use in Bangladesh.
