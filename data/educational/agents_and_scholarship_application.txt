# Context: The Role of Agents and the Practical Scholarship Application Process.

## 1. Role and Verification of Education Agents in Bangladesh
- **Function of Agents:** Official university representatives or agents in Bangladesh act as the primary point of contact. Their role is to provide counseling, assist with document collection, verify eligibility, explain the fee structure, and guide students through the application and visa process.
- **How to Verify an Agent:** The most reliable way is to contact the university's International Admissions Office directly via email or phone and ask for a list of their authorized representatives in Bangladesh. Students should be wary of agents not listed by the university.
- **Red Flags for Unofficial Agents:**
  - Demanding large sums of cash for "processing fees" beyond the official university application fee.
  - Promising guaranteed scholarships without assessing academic results.
  - Discouraging direct contact with the university.
  - Lack of an official office or professional communication.

## 2. Scholarship Application and Confirmation Process
- **Is the Scholarship Application Separate?** No. For Sharda University and similar institutions, the scholarship is not a separate application. It is automatically assessed based on the academic documents (HSC/Diploma marksheets) submitted during the main admission application.
- **How is the Scholarship Confirmed?** The scholarship amount (e.g., 20%, 50%) is explicitly mentioned in the **Provisional Offer Letter** issued by the university. This letter is the official confirmation of the scholarship.
- **Negotiation:** Scholarship percentages are fixed based on the university's policy and the student's CGPA/marks. They are generally non-negotiable.
- **Scholarship for Lateral Entry:** Diploma holders applying for lateral entry are also eligible for scholarships based on their final diploma CGPA/percentage.
