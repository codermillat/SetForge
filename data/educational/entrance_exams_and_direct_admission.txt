# Context: A Comprehensive Guide to Entrance Exams and the Direct Admission Process for Bangladeshi Students in India.

---
## 1. The Standard Indian Admission System: Entrance Exams

In India, admission to most professional and technical courses for domestic students is highly competitive and is based on national or state-level entrance examinations. Understanding this helps clarify why the process for international students is different.

- **JEE (Joint Entrance Examination):** The national-level exam for admission into premier engineering institutes like IITs, NITs, and other top government and private engineering colleges.
- **NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test):** The single national-level entrance exam for admission to all medical (MBBS), dental (BDS), and AYUSH courses in India.
- **CUET (Common University Entrance Test):** An all-India test for admission to various undergraduate, postgraduate, and other programs in Central Universities and other participating institutions.
- **State-Level Exams (e.g., UPTAC/UPSEE):** State-specific exams for admission to technical colleges within that state (like G.L. Bajaj's domestic admissions via AKTU).


**üéì OFFICIAL SCHOLARSHIP CRITERIA (2025-26):**

**Policy:** Based on aggregate percentage/GPA in qualifying examination

**Scholarship Tiers:**
‚Ä¢ **Level 1:** GPA 3.0-3.4 (60-69%) ‚Üí 20% scholarship
‚Ä¢ **Level 2:** GPA 3.5-5.0 (70-100%) ‚Üí 50% scholarship

**Important Conditions:**
‚Ä¢ Applies to: Tuition Fee only (not hostel/food/other fees)
‚Ä¢ Assessment: Aggregate percentage (not subject-wise performance)
‚Ä¢ Continuation: Pass all exams without any back paper/fail; Maintain minimum 75% attendance; Applicable from 2nd year onwards


**Key Point for Domestic Students:** For Indian students, scoring well in these exams is the primary and often the only way to secure a seat in a good university or college.

## 2. The Policy for Bangladeshi and International Students: Direct Admission

A major advantage for Bangladeshi and other international students at private universities like Sharda, Galgotias, Amity, and NIU is that they are **exempted from these competitive entrance exams**.

### What is Direct Admission?
- **No Entrance Exam Required:** Bangladeshi students do not need to appear for or qualify in JEE, NEET, CUET, or any other Indian entrance examination to get admission into these private universities.
- **Merit-Based on Previous Academics:** Admission is granted directly based on the student's academic performance in their previous qualifying examination.
  - **For Undergraduate Programs:** Admission is based on the marks/CGPA obtained in the **HSC (Class 12) or Diploma** examinations.
  - **For Postgraduate Programs:** Admission is based on the marks/CGPA obtained in the **Bachelor's degree**.

### Why is this Policy in Place?
- **Attracting Global Talent:** This policy is designed to make Indian universities more accessible and attractive to international students by removing the significant barrier of preparing for and competing in highly localized and competitive entrance exams.
- **Different Educational Systems:** Universities recognize that the curriculum and examination patterns in Bangladesh (and other countries) are different from the Indian system, making it impractical to have a common entrance test.

## 3. The Admission Process Without Entrance Exams

The process is simplified and focuses on document verification and eligibility checks.

1.  **Application:** The student submits their academic documents (HSC/Diploma marksheets, etc.) directly to the university or its authorized representative.
2.  **Eligibility Check:** The university's admissions team verifies if the student meets the minimum eligibility criteria for the chosen course (e.g., having Physics, Chemistry, and Maths for B.Tech).
3.  **Offer Letter:** If the criteria are met, the university issues a Provisional Offer Letter, confirming admission and any applicable scholarship based on the student's grades.
4.  **Final Admission:** The student confirms their seat by paying the initial admission fee.

### Exception: Amity University's Internal Assessment
- While Amity University also offers direct admission without requiring JEE or other national exams, it has its own internal screening process.
- After the initial application, prospective students are typically required to:
  1.  Take a short, online **English language test**.
  2.  Participate in a **video interview** with a faculty member.
- This is not a competitive entrance exam but rather an assessment to ensure the student has adequate communication skills and is a suitable candidate for the program.

## 4. Special Note on Medical (MBBS) Admissions
- **NEET is Mandatory for All:** The **only exception** to the direct admission rule is for the **MBBS program**. As per Indian government regulations, **all students**, including international and Bangladeshi students, **must qualify in the NEET exam** to be eligible for an MBBS seat anywhere in India.
- Private universities like Sharda or NIU cannot offer an MBBS seat to any student who has not cleared the NEET exam.
