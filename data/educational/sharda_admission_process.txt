# Context: The step-by-step admission and visa process for students from Bangladesh.

## Core Advantage for Bangladeshi Students
- **No IELTS/TOEFL Required:** Admission is based on academic merit.
- **Simplified Visa Process:** While the university admission does not require proof of funds, the visa application process requires a bank statement showing minimum BDT 1,00,000 as proof of financial stability.

## Required Documents for Application
1.  **Identity Proof:** A valid Passport is preferred. If not immediately available, a Birth Certificate or National ID Card can be used for the initial application.
2.  **Academic Transcripts:**
    - For Bachelor's Programs: Class 10 (SSC/Dakhil) and Class 12 (HSC/Alim) marksheets and certificates.
    - For Master's Programs: Bachelor's degree transcripts and certificate, in addition to 10th and 12th documents.
    - Online/provisional marksheets are acceptable if original board certificates are not yet issued.
3.  **Parent's ID:** National ID Card of parents.
4.  **Contact Details:** Student's full name, active phone number, and a valid email address.

## Admission Procedure
1.  **Initial Contact:** The student contacts the official Sharda University representatives for Bangladesh via WhatsApp, Email, or a Google Form.
2.  **Document Submission:** The student submits scanned copies of all required documents.
3.  **Offer Letter Issuance:** Upon successful verification, the university issues a Provisional Offer Letter. This letter confirms eligibility and details the course, tuition fees, and any scholarship awarded.
4.  **Admission Fee Payment:** To secure the seat, the student pays the one-time admission fee (approx. ‚Çπ52,000 for the 2025-26 session). This fee is separate from tuition and covers first-year medical insurance, registration, etc.
5.  **Final Letters for Visa:** After payment confirmation, the university provides two essential documents:
    - The Final Admission Letter.
    - A Visa Recommendation Letter for the Indian High Commission.
6.  **Visa Application:** The student applies for an Indian Student Visa at the designated Indian Visa Application Center (IVAC) in Bangladesh using the university-provided letters and their passport.
7.  **Final Steps:** Once the visa is approved, the student can travel to India. The remaining tuition fees are paid after arriving on campus.
