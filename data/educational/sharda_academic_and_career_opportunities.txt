# Context: Academic pathways, career support, and practical opportunities at Sharda University.

## Academic Pathways

This provides a cost-effective route to a Western degree.
- **Curriculum:** The curriculum for most programs, especially in engineering, is aligned with the IIT syllabus, ensuring high academic standards.

- **In-Campus Jobs:** Opportunities for part-time work within the campus are available.
