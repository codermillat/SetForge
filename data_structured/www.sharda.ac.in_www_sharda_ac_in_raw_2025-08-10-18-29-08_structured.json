This includes creating market strategies for startups, expanding the entrepreneurship culture beyond the institution to regional and community levels, and forming strategic international partnerships through various channels like exchange programs and faculty engagement.",
      "raw_content": "12 MIC g. Institute should develop and implement I & E strategy and policy for the entire institute in order to integrate the entrepreneurial activities across various centers, departments, faculties, within the institutes, thus breaking the silos. h. Product to market strategy for startups should be developed by the institute on case to case basis. i. Development of entrepreneurship culture should not be limited within the boundaries of the institution. i. HEIs should be the driving force in developing entrepreneurship culture in its vicinity (regional, social and community level). This shall include giving opportunity for regional startups, provision to extend facilities for outsiders and active involvement of the institute in defining strategic direction for local development. ii. Strategic international partnerships should be developed using bilateral and multilateral channels with international innovation clusters and other relevant organizations. Moreover, international exchange programs, internships, engaging the international faculties in teaching and research should also be promoted."

    "institutional_infrastructure": {
      "summary": "The text advises Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to establish pre-incubation and incubation facilities to foster innovation and startups. These facilities should be integrated with innovation efforts, aiming to connect innovation to enterprise and financial success. They should be accessible 24/7 to all students, staff, and faculty. While pre-incubation facilities can be informal, incubation units should ideally be separate, registered entities like Section-8 companies or societies, to ensure independent governance and better accountability. HEIs can offer services for fees, equity, or on a no-payment basis, with equity sharing modalities detailed elsewhere.",
      "raw_content": "2. Startups Enabling Institutional Infrastructure Creation of pre-incubation and incubation facilities for nurturing innovations and startups in HEIs institutions should be undertaken. Incubation and Innovation need to be organically interlinked. Without innovation, new enterprises are unlikely to succeed. The goal of the effort should be to link INNOVATION to ENTREPRISES to FINANCIAL SUCCESS. a. All HEIs are advised to create facilities within their institution for supporting pre-incubation (e.g. IICs as per the guidelines by MHRD’s Innovation Cell, EDC, IEDC, New-Gen IEDC, Innovation Cell, Startup Cell, Student Clubs, etc.) and Incubation/ acceleration by mobilizing resources from internal and external sources. b. This Pre-Incubation/Incubation facility should be accessible 24x7 to students, staff and faculty of all disciplines and departments across the institution. c. Pre-incubation facilities may or may not be a separately registered entity or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), but we recommend that ‘Incubation cum Technology Commercialization Unit’ (ITCU) should be a separate entity preferably registered under Section-8 of Company Act 2013 or 'Society' registered under Society Registration Act with independent governance structure. This will allow more freedom to Incubators in decision making with less administrative hassles for executing the programs related to innovation, IPR and Startups. Moreover, they will have better accountability towards investors supporting the incubation facility. d. HEIs may offer mentoring and other relevant services through Pre-incubation/Incubation units in-return for fees, equity sharing and (or) zero payment basis. The modalities regarding Equity Sharing in Startups supported through these units will depend upon the nature of services offered by these units and are elaborately explained in Section 3."

      "summary": "The institute should offer startup services through a flexible model combining equity, fees, and zero payment options, allowing startups to rent support without seed funding. This facility should be accessible to alumni and outsiders. Faculty participation in startup activities, including mentoring, should be recognized and rewarded in performance evaluations, alongside traditional duties like teaching and research. The institute must update its policies to reflect these changes, ensure no liability is incurred from startups, and consider modifying existing student/faculty startup policies in line with these guidelines.",
      "raw_content": "15 MIC k. The institute should also provide services based on mixture of equity, fee-based and/ or zero payment model. So, a startup may choose to avail only the support, not seed funding, by the institute on rental basis. l. Institute could extend this startup facility to alumni of the institute as well as outsiders. m. Participation in start uprelated activities needs to be considered as a legitimate activity of faculty in addition to teaching, R&D projects, industrial consultancy and management duties and must be considered while evaluating the annual performance of the faculty. Every faculty may be encouraged to mentor at least one startup. n. Product development and commercialization as well as participating and nurturing of startups would now be added to a bucket of faculty-duties and each faculty would choose a mix and match of these activities (in addition to minimum required teaching and guidance) and then respective faculty are evaluated accordingly for their performance and promotion. o. Institutions might also need to update/change/revise performance evaluation policies for faculty and staff as stated above. p. Institute should ensure that at no stage any liability accrue to it because of any activity of any startup. q. Where a student/ faculty startup policy is pre-existing in an institute, then the institute may consider modifying their policy in spirit of these guidelines."

If inventions arise from MIC office hours or are not part of the curriculum, inventors retain full ownership, with licensing decisions made by them. Disputes over ownership will be handled by a five-member committee of experienced faculty, alumni, industry experts, and legal advisors. The institute's IPR cell will act as a facilitator with no decision-making power on invention execution or licensing, though a committee may assess patent filing costs for institute-funded patents. Decisions on incubation and licensing will be made by faculty and experts experienced in technology translation, excluding administrative heads. The institution should also encourage interdisciplinary research and publications on startups and entrepreneurship.",

In this case, inventors can decide to license the technology to third parties or use the technology the way they deem fit. c. If there is a dispute in ownership, a minimum five membered committee consisting of two faculty members (having developed sufficient IPR and translated to commercialisation), two of the institute’s alumni/ industry experts (having experience in technology commercialisation) and one legal advisor with experience in IPR, will examine the issue after meeting the inventors and help them settle this, hopefully to everybody’s satisfaction. Institute can use alumni/ faculty of other institutes as members, if they cannot find sufficiently experienced alumni / faculty of their own. d. Institute IPR cell or incubation center will only be a coordinator and facilitator for providing services to faculty, staff and students. They will have no say on how the invention is carried out, how it is patented or how it is to be licensed. If institute is to pay for patent filing, they can have a committee which can examine whether the IPR is worth patenting. The committee should consist of faculty who have experience and excelled in technology translation. If inventors are using their own funds or non- institute funds, then they alone should have a say in patenting. e. All institute’s decision-making body with respect to incubation / IPR / technology-licensing will consist of faculty and experts who have excelled in technology translation. Other faculty in the department / institute will have no say, including heads of department, heads of institutes, deans or registrars. f. Interdisciplinary research and publication on startup and entrepreneurship should be promoted by the institutions."
