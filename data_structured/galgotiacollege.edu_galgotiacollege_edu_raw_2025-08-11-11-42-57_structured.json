VISION\n\n-- Page 21 --\n3 3 WELCOME TO GCET Galgotias Educational Institutions (GEI) comprising of Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology (GCET) were founded by Smt. Shakuntla Educational and Welfare Society. Shri Suneel Galgotia, a resolute visionary, committed to provide world class technical and management education. As the founder of Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology and Managing Director of Galgotia Publications Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, he exemplifies a profound dedication to excellence in education. The Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology is approved by AICTE, Ministry of HRD, Government of India and affiliated to Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow formerly Uttar Pradesh Technical University. Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology, established in 2000, synergizes theoretical knowledge and practical skills to promote all round professional competence. Its unrivalled status in UP, the NCR region and the country stem from its remarkable achievement in nurturing professionals of national and international repute and has been recognized as one of the top ranking institutions imparting high quality education. Nestled across 19 sprawling acres, the campus enjoys a prime location on an 8-lane expressway connecting Greater Noida with Noida and New Delhi. The heaven of self- sufficiency, it boasts splendidly designed academic buildings, secure and comfortable hostels for both boys and girls, state-of-the-art seminar and conference halls and well- equipped indoor and outdoor sports facilities. To compliment the enriching experience, a multi-cuisine cafeteria caters to the culinary delights of the students.\n\n-- Page 22 --\n4 The whole purpose of education at GEI is to develop and nurture Brilliant Brains who will shape the future of the nation “ “\n\n-- Page 23 --\n5 Constantly ranked as one of the top engineering institutions in Uttar Pradesh & one among the top fifty colleges in India (by Data Quest survey), Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology is now on it’s twenty third year with great success as a premier technical institution. It has emerged as one of the most preferred institutes of Engineering & Management. Twelve batches have already graduated from our institution and today we are among the best education providers in the AKTU system. Our results are exemplary good from the merit point of view as well as from the placement perspective. Our students have been placed in the best organizations of the country. Some of them went to abroad for higher studies and for jobs in multinational companies. All in all, the last fifteen years have been a challenging and rewarding experience for us. With an aim to remain quality conscious, efficient and responsive to today’s rapidly changing economic and technological developments, Galgotias Educational Institutions has taken up the challenge for not only to provide technical and corporate training to the students, but also delivers the effort to make them self-confident, better human beings with leadership qualities. Galgotias Educational Institutions (GEI) comprising of Galgotias Institute of Management & Technology (GIMT) & Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology (GCET), Galgotias College of Pharmacy and Galgotias University were founded by Smt. Shakuntla Educational & Welfare Society. GEI has evolved as a symbol of quality education dedicated to nurture the talent and aspiration of the dynamic, vibrant & bright youth of our country. Globalization has brought in its wake an emphasis on consumer concerns, such as quality (quality assurance is the need of the hour for continuous up gradation), infrastructure and teaching-learning processes. Economic restructuring of any country heavily depends on the institutional’s performance and technology driven teaching practices. The faculty at GEI is inspired by our vision to be known as one of world’s premier educational institutions for multidisciplinary education and research. Galgotias Educational Institutions has introduced such practices to develop young students as engineers and managers to meet the demands of society. In the wake of the crisis in the industry, it is important to be a step ahead, a step faster and surer. The students are trained to equip themselves to take on the world and carve out a niche’s in tomorrow’s world, so that they are assured of not only promising career opportunities but are well equipped to face the challenges of life as well. It goes without saying that science, technology and engineering though different entities are related and interact with one another in complex ways. The engineer’s main task is to apply his scientific knowledge to the solution of technical problems, then to optimize solution within the given material, technological, economic, social and environmental constraints for the utility, comfort and advancement of mankind while management peoples should have the sound skill of planning, organizing, staffing and directing, they must have good leading nature for controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or to accomplishing a desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Our aim is to provide high class engineering and management education and we are committed to do it. In short, science is preoccupied with the understanding and explaining, engineering is concerned with doing, realizing and implementing while management is the art and science of decision making and leadership. Thus, the aim of future engineering and management education should be the integration of knowledge, skills, understanding and experience for providing creative and very professional youth who can serve our nation very well. Shri Suneel Galgotia FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN\n\n-- Page 24 --\n\n-- Page 25 --\n7 7 Success in the current digital era lies at the convergence of technology, skill and education. Artificial Intelligence, automation, machine learning - each of these underscores the need for rapid and flexible responses from academia. We at Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology are constantly revamping and upskilling to stay ahead of the learning curve and keep up with the fast-changing and tech-savvy world. I am committed to preparing technically sound graduates for not only the current jobs but equip them with life long learning skills for futuristic corporate world requirements and entrepreneurship also. We at the Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology work closely with business leaders, regulators, local bodies and other statutory bodies to ensure that the education imparted is relevant and contemporary. I am deeply conscious of the fact that scientific and technological advancements, though critical, are by themselves not sufficient for the welfare of mankind. The main purpose of education is to enrich the character and hence we also focus on development of moral values and intellectual integrity in our students. Ability to think critically, make informed decisions, being confident in social situations and leadership are some of the qualities that we develop in the young persons who chose Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology. I am confident that with this transformative education our students will be ready to take their rightful place as high contributing citizens of our great nation. The Campus is teeming with activities such as student clubs, sports, cultural performances, hackathons etc. which create a rich and vibrant culture. I welcome all the students and encourage you to take advantage of the opportunities that the GEI has to offer. I wish you all the very best as you set out on this incredible journey at the institute which will shape your destiny.

Given that our students are headed to serve industry and society, the college ensures industry-led syllabi and continual industry interface through the entire duration of their education. When industry has been involved with the gestation and development of student talent that is completely in-sync with industry-needs, then placement of students usually is a foregone conclusion even before the end of a student body’s academic education. In our quest to involve corporates to the maximum, Galgotias College has in place many models of college-industry partnership ranging across accreditations, MoU arrangements and academic alliances. These integration initiatives help architect the education experience and deepen and enrich it. ACCREDITATION WITH TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LTD.

The GEI system aims to fulfill students’ aspirations across various sectors of industry. Students can confidently hope to enter the corporate world in sectors and positions commensurate with their capabilities. This environment of opportunities for the students is a result of a well-structured interface with corporates. Students can take on the best of all the opportunities GEI provides. For this they have to go through rigorous corporate-readiness programs which run concurrently with their academic programs. These comprise industry visits, mentorship activity, field research work, corporate interface and faculty-monitored corporate internship programs. Leading organizations across various disciplines participate in campus placements at GEI. Nearly all students are placed almost a year before they complete their academic studies.
