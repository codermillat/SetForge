Born amidst the bustling streets of New Delhi, Suneel’s early years were steeped in a love for knowledge. Growing up surrounded by books in his family’s renowned bookstore, E.D. Galgotia and Sons, nestled in Connaught Place, he found his passion. It was here, among the shelves of knowledge, that Suneel’s dream to make a difference through education was born.\nThe bookstore was not just a business; it was a sanctuary for intellectuals and students alike. People would say, “If you can’t find a book at Galgotia's, you won’t find it anywhere.” But even a legacy as strong as this could not shield Suneel from life’s challenges. The sudden loss of his father and family disputes left him with no claim to the business. Forced to walk away from both his family home and the bookstore, Suneel faced an uncertain future.\nBut where many might have seen defeat, Suneel saw an opportunity to rise. With nothing but a small sum of five hundred rupees and a heart full of ambition, he pursued his education at St. Columba’s School and later Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), one of India’s finest institutions. Even though financial struggles loomed large, his determination never wavered. Suneel’s perseverance earned him SRCC’s Distinguished and Most Revered Alumni Award—a recognition of his unyielding spirit and unstoppable rise.\nFrom a Dream to Reality: The Birth of Galgotias\nIn 1980, Suneel made a bold move. Armed with passion and resilience, he launched Galgotias Publications. Though the odds were against him, he secured distribution rights for the prestigious Barrons SAT, TOEFL, GRE, and GMAT books, a monumental feat in India. This venture wasn't just about business; it was about making education more accessible. Suneel’s strategic brilliance turned challenges into breakthroughs, establishing Galgotias as a leader in the Indian educational landscape.\nIn his early publishing days, he took a leap of faith by borrowing Rs 9000 to print his first book, \"Power System Control and Stability\" by Anderson. Through careful negotiation and sheer grit, Suneel turned what seemed impossible into a remarkable success. The lesson was clear: with courage and strategy, even the most daunting obstacles could be overcome.\nBut Suneel’s dream wasn’t just about books. It was about building a legacy of education. In 2000, he founded Galgotias Institute of Management & Technology (GIMT) with just 40 students and then the famous Galgotias College of Engineering and technology in the year 2000. His vision for a world-class institution offering skill-based education took a giant leap forward in 2011 when he established Galgotias University.\nA Vision Beyond the Classroom\nSuneel’s vision was never limited to textbooks. He saw education as the bridge between knowledge and the real world. Under his leadership, Galgotias University became synonymous with excellence, offering innovative programs tailored to the needs of a rapidly changing job market. Today, it stands tall with 40,000 students from over 40 countries, and more than 100,000 alumni spread across 96 countries.\nThe road to success was anything but smooth. Suneel faced numerous hurdles—from securing funds to finding the land needed to build his dream- Affordable Quality education for all. When questioned by government officials about the lack of land, he didn’t falter. With no immediate resources, he boldly promised to acquire the land within ten days. Through his ingenuity, Suneel managed to convert a loan intended for his bookstore into the financial backing he needed to purchase land. His determination was unshakable, and soon, the university took shape.\nCreating a Legacy of Excellence\nUnder Suneel’s leadership, Galgotias University reached unprecedented heights. It became the first in Uttar Pradesh to receive an A+ ranking with the highest score from NAAC, and it consistently ranks among the top institutions for patent filings and innovation. But beyond the accolades, what truly drives Suneel is the impact on individual lives—students from humble backgrounds achieving extraordinary success. From a village student securing a dream job in a global firm to a farmer’s child becoming an IAS officer, these stories represent the true heart of Suneel’s legacy.\nThe Next Generation: A Family’s Shared Vision\nSuneel’s children share his passion for education. His son, Dr. Dhruv Galgotia, now leads the university as CEO, ensuring it remains a hub of innovation and learning.He is changing the traditional way teaching and learning is done in classrooms and bringing a more active, collaborative and engaging approach to the pedagogy so every student feels involved and brings out the best in terms of creativity.\nHis daughter, Adv. Aradhana Galgotia, contributes her legal expertise, enhancing the university’s inclusivity and student experience. Together, they are building on the foundation Suneel created, ensuring that Galgotias University continues to shape the future and is one of the most preferred university in the country.\nLooking Forward: A Global Vision\nSuneel Galgotia’s journey is far from over. His sights are set on creating a global learning hub, collaborating with international institutions to bring the best of education to India. His unwavering belief in the power of education to transform lives remains the driving force behind his relentless pursuit of excellence.\nA Life of Inspiration\nFrom humble beginnings in a family bookstore to building one of India’s leading educational institutions, Suneel Galgotia’s life is a testament to the power of perseverance, vision, and hope. His story is a beacon of inspiration, reminding us all that with determination, even the most insurmountable obstacles can be turned into stepping stones for success. Through Galgotias University, his legacy of empowerment, inclusivity, and excellence will continue to inspire generations to come.\nSchool of Finance and Commerce\nSchool of Liberal Education\nSchool of Medical and Allied Sciences\nSchool of Nursing\nSchool of Allied Health Sciences\nSchool of Basic Sciences\nSchool of Media & Communication Studies\nSchool of Design\nSchool of Biosciences and Technology\nSchool of Vocational Education\nSchool of Life Long Learning\nCovid-19 Counselling Cell\nAdmission & Education Loan Assistance\nARIIA-2021\nTender & Vendor Registration\nViksit Bharat@2047: Voice of Youth\nInternal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC)\nDPBH 2023\nGalgotias University Vision 2030\nGalgotias News Network (GNN)\nFees Payment\nSIH -2023 and 2024\n© 2025 Copyrights Galgotias.
