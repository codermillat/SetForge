The curriculum is very good and jam-packed. Course provides a holistic learning for an individual, the campus is good and beautiful too.

The Library Resources are the greatest treasure trove for reading and researching for assignments and projects. The lecturers are super friendly and patient, and the lectures are delivered through hybrid means.
