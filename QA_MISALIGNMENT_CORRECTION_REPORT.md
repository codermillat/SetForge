# QA Dataset Misalignment Correction Report

## Executive Summary
Systematically corrected 12 critically misaligned Q&A entries from the production dataset, addressing semantic mismatches where answers didn't correspond to questions. All corrections validated against actual source files and enhanced with proper metadata alignment.

## Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Semantic Misalignment Issues
**Problem:** Questions about admission documents receiving answers about visa processing times
**Example Before:** Q: "What documents are required for admission?" A: "Visa processing takes 5-15 working days..."
**Solution:** Regenerated with proper admission document requirements from source files

### 2. Template Generation Failures
**Problem:** Generic templates producing fragmented or irrelevant content
**Example Before:** Q: "University comparison?" A: "Payment method warnings and incomplete information..."
**Solution:** Created context-specific answers using actual university comparison data

### 3. Metadata Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Confidence levels, personas, and tone markers not matching actual content quality
**Solution:** Realigned all metadata fields with corrected content and added "millat_manual_review" validation
