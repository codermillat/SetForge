You are an expert document analyst. Your task is to read the following document and split it into logical, self-contained chunks based on the topics you identify.

**Instructions:**

1.  Read the entire document to understand its structure and content.
2.  Identify the main topics discussed in the document. Common topics include, but are not limited to:
    *   `fee_structure`: Detailed information about course fees, hostel fees, or other charges.
    *   `course_curriculum`: Information about courses, semesters, subjects, credits, and curriculum details.
    *   `admission_requirements`: Eligibility criteria, application process, and admission deadlines.
    *   `scholarship_info`: Details about available scholarships, eligibility, and application procedures.
    *   `country_specific_scholarship`: Information about scholarships targeted at students from specific countries or regions.
    *   `contact_info`: Addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other contact details.
    *   `general_info`: General information about the organization, its history, vision, or other non-specific content.
3.  For each identified topic, create a JSON object containing two keys:
    *   `"topic"`: A string representing the topic (e.g., "fee_structure").
    *   `"content"`: A string containing the exact, verbatim text from the document that corresponds to that topic.
4.  Return a JSON array of these objects. Ensure the JSON is well-formed.

**Example Output:**

```json
[
  {{
    "topic": "admission_requirements",
    "content": "For National Students: Matriculation with-60% marks Sr. Secondary (10+2) 60% marks (Aggregate) & minimum 60% marks in PCM Computer Science/PCB for Biotechnology without gap between 10th and 12th."
  }},
  {{

    "content": "Course Fee\n• Yearly Fee\n• Semester Fee\n1st Year\n270000 | 2nd Year\n278100 | 3rd Year\n286443 | 4th Year\n295036"
  }}
