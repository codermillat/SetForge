# The SetForge Project: A Guide for Non-Technical Writers

## 1. The Big Idea: Creating a "Super-Specialist" AI

Imagine you want to build the world's best expert on a very specific topic: helping students from Bangladesh get into universities in India.

A general-purpose AI like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini is like a massive public library. It knows a little bit about everything, but it doesn't have deep, specialized knowledge on our niche topic. It might give generic advice that isn't quite right for a Bangladeshi student's unique situation.

Our goal with SetForge is to create a **"super-specialist" AI**. This AI will be trained on a custom-made dataset that makes it an unparalleled expert in our chosen field. When a student asks it a question, it will provide answers that are not just correct, but also nuanced, culturally aware, and deeply relevant.

To do this, we need to create the perfect "textbook" for our AI to study from. This "textbook" is our **Q&A dataset**.

## 2. The Analogy: The Library Research Team

Think of our project like a highly efficient library research team tasked with writing this perfect textbook. The team has two main roles:

1.  **The Fast Researcher (Our "Draftsman" AI)**: This is a smart, incredibly fast researcher. We give them a huge pile of raw documents (university websites, visa rules, etc.) and their job is to read everything and quickly write down thousands of *draft* questions and answers. They are fast and cover everything, but their work might be a bit rough around the edges.

2.  **The Expert Editor (Our "Editor" AI)**: This is a world-class, senior editor. They are more methodical and precise. They take each draft Q&A pair from the Fast Researcher and polish it to perfection. They check every fact against the original documents, improve the wording, and ensure the final product is clear, accurate, and trustworthy.

By combining the speed of the Fast Researcher with the precision of the Expert Editor, we can create a massive, high-quality textbook faster and more effectively than either could alone.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

**Step 1: Gather Raw Information**
*   **What we do**: We collect hundreds of documents from the internet. This includes university websites, official visa requirement pages, scholarship details, and course descriptions.
*   **The result**: A folder full of messy, raw data (`data/raw/`).

**Step 2: Clean the Documents**
*   **What we do**: Computers are easily confused by website menus, ads, and other clutter. We run a program (`ContentExtractor`) that acts like a digital pair of scissors, cutting away all the unnecessary parts and leaving only the clean, core text.
*   **The result**: A new folder of clean, easy-to-read text files (`data/cleaned/`).

**Step 3: The "Fast Researcher" Creates Drafts (The Draftsman Stage)**
*   **What we do**: This is where our "Fast Researcher" AI gets to work. This AI runs on a dedicated, private computer (a Google Colab GPU) so it can work incredibly fast without any interruptions or limits.
*   **How it works**: Our main program (`DataStructurer`) sends each clean text file to the Fast Researcher. The Fast Researcher reads the text and creates hundreds of draft Q&A pairs from it.
*   **The result**: A huge collection of draft Q&A pairs. They are good, but not yet perfect.

**Step 4: The "Expert Editor" Polishes the Drafts (The Editor Stage)**
*   **What we do**: Now, our "Expert Editor" AI (the powerful Google Gemini model) takes over.
*   **How it works**: Our `Refinement` program shows each draft Q&A pair to the Expert Editor and gives it a simple command: "Make this perfect." The Editor reviews the draft, compares it to the original document to ensure it's factually correct, and rewrites it to be clearer and more natural-sounding.
*   **The result**: A set of polished, high-quality Q&A pairs.

**Step 5: Quality Control Check**
*   **What we do**: Before we approve a Q&A pair for the final textbook, we run it through one last check (`FactCheckingGroundingValidator`).
*   **How it works**: This program acts like a meticulous fact-checker. It reads the final answer and verifies that every single fact in it can be found in the original source document. This is our guarantee against the AI "making things up" (hallucinating).
*   **The result**: Only Q&A pairs that are 100% grounded in facts move on.

**Step 6: The Final, Polished Q&A Dataset**
*   **What we do**: All the Q&A pairs that have passed our rigorous quality control are collected and formatted into a final file (`dataset.jsonl`).
*   **The result**: Our "perfect textbook"â€”a high-quality, reliable, and deeply specialized dataset, ready to be used to train our "super-specialist" AI.

## 4. Glossary of Key Terms

*   **Dataset**: The collection of Q&A pairs we are creating. It's the textbook our AI will learn from.
*   **LLM (Large Language Model)**: A powerful AI that can read, understand, and generate human-like text. (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini).
*   **Fine-Tuning**: The process of taking a general-purpose LLM and training it further on a specialized dataset to make it an expert in a specific domain.
*   **Endpoint/API**: Think of this as a private phone line to our "Fast Researcher" AI. Our program can call this line to give it tasks and get results back instantly.
*   **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: A powerful type of computer chip that is excellent at running AI models. We use a free one from Google Colab.
*   **Hallucination**: When an AI generates information that is incorrect or not based on the data it was given. Our quality control step is designed to prevent this.
